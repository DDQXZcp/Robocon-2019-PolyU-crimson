## SRAM and flash of MCU

### SRAM - CANNOT store memory when power off, slow

Static random-access memory (static RAM or SRAM) is a type of semiconductor random-access memory (RAM) that uses bistable latching circuitry (flip-flop) to store each bit. SRAM exhibits data remanence,[1] 
but it is still volatile in the conventional sense that data is eventually lost when the memory is not powered.

### flash - can store memory when power off, fast(compared to flash)

Flash memory is an electronic (solid-state) non-volatile computer memory storage medium that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. The two main types of flash memory are named after the NAND and NOR logic gates. The individual flash memory cells, consisting of floating-gate MOSFETs (floating-gate metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors), 
exhibit internal characteristics similar to those of the corresponding gates

### Comparison

SRAM - CANNOT store memory when power off, slow

We usually store variables in SRAM

flash - can store memory when power off, fast(compared to flash)

We usually store code in flash
